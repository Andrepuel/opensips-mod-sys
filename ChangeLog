	In script and MI function dp_translate, the partition is now a separate optional param (from the dpid).

2019-04-03  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [5ad04ac4d] :

	Fix concurrent parsing over samed shm message.
	As print_rr_body() may be called from different processes but over the same shm request, the performed parsing may lead to conflicts (different procs will fight one each other in setting the "parsed" field of the hdr_field in shm.
	This will easily lead to memory corruption and crashes. As real case, different replies to the same request may trigger print_rr_body in topology_hiding(), over the same shm cloned request.
	The newly added paramter (no_change) will instruct print_rr_body() to do its job but without changing anything in the inout set of RR hdrs.

	Better restore the correct event after forcing the handling of the BLF publish as presence, so the clustering layer will see the corrent event type.

	* [8e61c9542] :

	HP_MALLOC: Make HP_MALLOC_FAST_STATS great again
	To reiterate the idea behind HP_MALLOC_FAST_STATS:

	    * core problem: atomic SHM stat counters are nice, but they do
	      include locking!
	    * with this flag, there are almost no stat computations at runtime
	      (allocs, frees, reallocs will only +/- the numbers of fragments)
	    * every time user asks for, say, shmem:real_used_size, the stat
	      will be fully re-computed, at most once every second.


2019-04-02  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [8b19dab59] :

	Fix HP_MALLOC statistics with multi allocators
	With multiple allocators, the SHM stats table will declare a bunch of
	function-based statistics.  While this works fine for F_MALLOC and
	Q_MALLOC, HP_MALLOC requires atomic counter statistics, due to its
	parallel processing nature.  So, for HP_MALLOC, we now re-declare its
	stats during the init phase to be atomic counters instead of functions
	-- not the most elegant solution, but it's quick and not by far dirty.

	Thanks to Razvan Crainea for the report! <3

	OPS-6: Major allocator rework - F_MALLOC is functional
	The purpose of this rework is to be able to do the following:
	    * be able to compile an inlined allocator
		(same performance as now, same binary footprint)
	    * be able to compile an inlined, dbg allocator
		(same dbg performance as now, same larger binary footprint)
	    * be able to compile multiple allocators
		(a bit slower, somewhat flexible, larger+ binary footprint)
	    * be able to compile multiple, dbg allocators
		(even slower, most flexible: 3 allocators + 3 dbg allocators,
		    larger++ binary footprint)

	This commit creates the framework for the above.  QM_MALLOC and
	HP_MALLOC are currently completely broken, but F_MALLOC inlining is
	working well, with or w/o DBG_MALLOC.

	DEV-1: Digest the pp tokens within lexer, not parser!
	Using the lexer to consume the preprocessor tokens makes life so much
	easier, as otherwise the complexity of the scripting language grammer
	would skyrocket.  Example problem which is avoided by this:

	if
	<pp_token may go here>
	(
	<pp_token may go here>
	condition
	<pp_token may go here>
	)
	<pp_token may go here>
	{
	<pp_token may go here>
	$var(x) = 5;
	<pp_token may go here>
	}

	Although the coding style is horrible, this is still valid script
	syntax, but, all of a sudden, the grammar must be extended in order to
	support random tokens on any possible line of this "if" statement.
	Nope, not going there.  Just use the lexer to eat the tokens and be done
	with the problem!

	DEV-1: Implement config file flattening + adnotations
	The main idea is to be able to feed the preprocessor with a contiguous
	stream of input.  The consequence of doing this is that we must
	pre-resolve all "include_file" statements by creating one large cfg
	file, in a process called "flattening".

	Example of flattening + adnotation:

	------ cfg/opensips-3.0-preproc-1.cfg ------
	log_level = 4
	log_stderror = yes

	include_file "cfg/opensips-3.0-preproc-2.cfg"
	loadmodule "tm.so"
	include_file "cfg/opensips-3.0-preproc-4.cfg"
	loadmodule "dialog.so"

	------ cfg/opensips-3.0-preproc-2.cfg ------
	listen = udp:*:5060
	include_file "cfg/opensips-3.0-preproc-3.cfg"

	------ cfg/opensips-3.0-preproc-3.cfg ------
	mpath = "modules/"
	loadmodule "proto_udp.so"

	------ cfg/opensips-3.0-preproc-4.cfg ------
	loadmodule "usrloc.so"

	These four files with nested includes will be flattened into this beast:

	rr: Fix a buffer mgm bug during strict routing callbacks
	While doing strict routing (e.g. the R-URI host is a local domain) and

	memory pointer as the result of the rr_api.get_route_param() function.

	Although opensips would not crash due to the dangling pointer residing
	in pkg memory, some callbacks would misbehave (e.g. uac_auth() would
	fail to adjust the outbound ACK CSeq, since it cannot locate the ";aci"
	Route header field parameter within the dangling pkg area).

	The module will listen for all the changes of the sharing tag status, to see when the local node becomes active for one of its own tags -> if so, it must fire out all the registrations marked with that tag.
	Still to be done: the unregister all and register when becoming active.

	acc: Do not dereference NULL dialog contexts
	This bug could be triggered in failover scenarios, where the accounting
	context would be created and cleaned up at least once before actually

	    * create_dialog();
	    * $acc_extra(foo) = "bar"; # create a dialog-stored acc context
	    * t_relay(); exit; # msg is relayed, but ctx is unused =>
		the code frees it and leaves a NULL dialog value marker.
	    * inside failure_route, do: $acc_extra(foo) = "bar".  We fetch the
	      NULL context stored inside dialog, dereference it and crash.

	dialog: fix behavior of backup node when replicating dialogs
	The node that has a backup state for the sharing tag of a dialog
	was incorrectly:
	* skipping the replication of all dialog events
	* bypassing all registered DLGCB_TERMINATED and DLGCB_EXPIRED callbacks

	This behavior was causing issues when replies and sequential requests did
	arrive on the backup node. Eg. unable to match and fix the BYE for an
	existing topology hiding dialog.

	After this fix, only the acc and cgrates modules will skip all actions in the
	above mentioned callbacks if the sharing tag is backup.

	Length can be positive or negative.

	* [ac549a0d5] :

	async: fix fd leaking and invalid memory overwrite
	when calling `reactor_del_reader(*fd, ...)`, the `*fd` will become -1.
	The reason is because `fd` points to a `io_wait_h->fd_no`, that will get
	changed to `-1` at the end of the function. Hence the actual `*fd` value
	will be lost, and `close(*fd)` is a no-op, resulting in original fd
	leaking. Moreover, when assigning `*fd` a new value, we will be
	overwriting the `io_wait_h->fd_no` in the reactor, resulting in
	undefined behavior.
	This commit stores the actual value of `*fd` in a local variable and
	uses it throught the function, making sure the `io_wait_h->fd_no` is not
	overwritten and the `close()` function is called on the proper fd.

	Many thangs to Eric Tamme (lirakis) on IRC for reporting this.

	rest_client: Fix some POST/PUT corner-cases
	This patch addresses two rare bugs such that they may now only occur

	When calling rest_post() or rest_put(), assuming we're fetching the
	request body buffer into "req_body" via fixup_get_svalue():

	    1. since req_body->s is not dup'ed and may point to a PV buf,
		the next SIP message may impact the currently "just launched"
		async transfer by overriding the value stored in the PV buffer
		before libcurl fully reads it

	    2. req_body->s is provided by a PV which does not NULL-terminate
		strings (e.g. $du), thus curl's strlen() may overflow or crash

	This commit fixes the following bugs introduced in commit 00cddf7:
	1. when it was called, it was removing all the linkers of a dialog
	2. it was not removing the actual linker it was called for, causing
	constant increase in size for that specific profile (and leak)
	3. when temporary copying the profiles list, the values were not copied,
	thus they might have dissapeared when the actual cleanup was done.

	systemd: Properly shut down OpenSIPS 2.4+ instances
	OpenSIPS 2.4 is meant to be shut down gracefully, in order to minimize
	any form of data corruption caused by partial processing of SIP
	messages.  Running "killall opensips" has a good chance of deadlocking
	OpenSIPS for the next 45 seconds, especially if it's doing a lot of
	logging.  This is often the case with the current systemd logic.

	This patch updates the opensips systemd service files so they only
	deliver SIGTERM to the attendant process.


2018-07-04  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [9c5b1b950] :

	core: Greatly reduce chance of truncated corefiles
	Before commit 8073d4de8ed, the SIGTERM signal delivered by the attendant
	process to a process who had already crashed and would be dumping its
	memory inside the SIGSEGV handler would stay queued and not disrupt the
	generation of the corefile.  At worst, corefile generation would take
	above "shutdown_time" seconds (60), and OpenSIPS would SIGKILL its
	entire process group and definitively terminate.

	Now, OpenSIPS behavior has changed to:
	    * attendant broadcasts a graceful IPC shutdown job
	    * attendant gives _everyone_ a grand total of 5 seconds to finish
	    * if not ready -> SIGKILL the entire instance

	This behavior is too restrictive for the average spinning disk
	performance.  Coupled with the fact that SHM pools of 2+ GB are common
	nowadays AND the fact that, occasionally, corefiles come in multiples, 5
	seconds is not a lot of time.

	This patch fixes the behavior to:
	    * attendant broadcasts a graceful IPC shutdown job
	    * attendant gives non-crashed processes 5 seconds to obey
	    * if not ready -> SIGKILL any processes which are still running
	    * perform cleanup(60 sec) (leave the core-dumping processes alone)
	    * exit or abort cleanup (leave the core-dumping processes alone)

	Thanks to Bogdan for significantly directing the design of this patch


2018-07-03  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [28e00f74f] :

	core: Clean up outdated SIGKILL-based shutdown code
	When not in "debug" mode (i.e. when opensips successfully daemonizes),
	the kill_all_children(SIGKILL) function will actually send SIGKILL
	to the entire process group ID, including its owner.  In this case, all
	code that follows after it is _dead_ code.

	This includes the final cleanup() sequence, which would be desirable to
	run even during an emergency shutdown (e.g. OpenSIPS deadlocked,
	SIGKILL'ed all its children, yet managed to do a last-second DB dump of
	all dialogs and contacts).

	This patch fixes the following:

	    * rewrite kill_all_children() to actually do what it says: "only
	      kill the children".  No need to send kill() to the pgid.

	    * remove the alarm()+wait() logic around kill_all_children(SIGKILL).
	      Even if opensips is not daemonized (so the SIGKILL only gets sent
	      to each enumerated process), if, by absurd, we failed to count all
	      processes within the for() loop of the first call, installing a
	      signal handler for yet another kill_all_children(SIGKILL) call is
	      pretty much useless -- we will still stay stuck in while(wait()).

	    * remove the "now unused" sig_alarm_kill() function

	    * improve function docs

	Commit a03ed4e1a36 over-simplified the downstream leg identification,
	assuming that there is a 1:1 correspondence between outgoing branches
	and unique replies to them.  This is not the case: as a proxy, we may
	receive multiple responses (read: "To" tags) for each individual branch
	we fork out.  This misconception would also cause SHM to leak.

	We fix the above limitation by cloning a new dialog leg each time we
	detect downstream forking of our outgoing branches.

	Thanks to Bogdan for pointing out this problem

	When mapping parameters to ISUP by default, a P-Asserted-Identity number
	longer than 15 digits would cause an infinite loop in the worker process
	until running out of memory.

	Also raised the logging level(to INFO) of some useful messages when unable
	to map ISUP parameters by default.

	Thanks to Rinor Hoxha for reporting.

	Closes #1390

	path: Fix "use_path_received" in double-Path scenarios
	Due to the fact that run_rr_callbacks() returns the 2nd Route (Path)
	header field value when previously having done protocol switching (thus
	having inserted two Path headers), the "use_path_received" feature of
	the path module would not work -- it wouldn't set the $du at all.

	The reason for this is that add_path_received() appends its ";received="
	to inside Path #1 (the outbound path of the registration / the inbound
	path of future requests) when doing double-Path recording.

	This patch simply moves the ";received=" append operation performed by
	add_path_received() into Path #2 (inbound path of registration /
	outbound path of future requests), and adapts other code that needs it
	(e.g. save("location", "p1v")) to properly be able to fetch it.

	Reported by @futsystems

2018-05-24  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [b3bf15646] :

	path: Add escaping logic for add_path_received()
	Simply dumping a SIP URI as a ";received=" Path header field parameter
	value is problematic and leads to two kinds of issues:

	a. invalid SIP URIs, where the ";transport=" is specified twice:

	Path: <sip:127.0.0.1:5061;transport=tcp;lr; ...
	       ... received=sip:127.0.0.1:51959;transport=tcp>

	b. in double Path scenarios (e.g. when switching protocols from, say,
	TCP -> UDP), since the ";received=" is inserted as the
	inbound Path header field value, this can lead to a strange
	"protocol conversion" effect:

	Path: <sip:127.0.0.1:5061;r2=on;lr ...
	       ... ;received=sip:127.0.0.1:42917;transport=tcp>
	Path: <sip:127.0.0.1:5061;transport=tcp;r2=on;lr>

	^ notice how the inbound Path intended to advertise an UDP URI, but the
	add_path_received() managed to "convert" it into a TCP URI because of
	its inability to escape its token. nathelper is an easy first victim of
	this conversion, as it will attempt to send pings using the incorrect
	transport after reading the topmost Path (Route) header.

	This patch adds escaping/unescaping logic for the ";received=" feature
	of add_path_received() along with any code that makes use of this
	feature. Example resulting URI for the above example:

	Path: <sip:127.0.0.1:5061;r2=on;lr ...
	       ... ;received=sip:127.0.0.1:42917%3dtransport%3btcp>

	Starting with 2.4, we change this behavior such that they default

	* [a03ed4e1a] :

	dialog: Fix Re-INVITE pinging issues with parallel forking
	The Re-INVITE pinging code would always leak both SDP and contact buffers
	when parallel forking. Moreover, depending on which branch answered
	the call, in some cases OpenSIPS would only Re-INVITE ping one of the
	parties involved, even if both "Rr" create_dialog() flags are set.

	This patch fixes the above issues by storing the SDPs of each forked
	branch into the "callee" leg array. Each call leg gets created before
	the INVITE branch is sent out, rather than only getting created upon
	matching a 200 OK reply. When matching a reply, the corresponding leg
	becomes 1 + the Via branch idx, which added by tm. (0, 1, 2, ...)

	Remaining issue:
	Proper handling for the multi-200 OK scenario, as we currently still
	overwrite the callee SDP at each 200 OK.

2018-04-13  Vlad Patrascu  <vladp at opensips dot org>
	* [0784c38b1] :

	dialog: drop inactive DB loaded dialogs when syncing from cluster is done
	Dialogs loaded from the database at startup are dropped and also deleted from
	the DB once the sync from cluster is complete. This is valid for dialogs that
	are not reconfirmed as being active in the meantime (SIP updates, received
	in sync data).


2018-04-13  Vlad Patrascu  <vladp at opensips dot org>
	* [d11aa92bb] :

	dialog: fix DB operations to be performed by all nodes in the cluster
	In the context of dialog replication and with the new feature of
	synchronization at startup, there is no longer the need for the DB backend
	to be shared between the nodes in the cluster. Each node can still have a
	local dialog table but only for restart persistency as a failsafe for the
	binary replication.


2018-04-13  Vlad Patrascu  <vladp at opensips dot org>
	* [bcc3d8c0f] :

	dialog: call values/profiles write callbacks before replicating dialogs
	Rename DLGCB_DB_WRITE_VP to DLGCB_WRITE_VP since it should also be
	triggered when replicating a created dialog. This allow modules
	to properly save context information in the dialog which can then be
	visibile on all instances where the dialog is replicated.

	This fixes issues with received replicated dialogs in acc, cgrates and
	siprec modules.

	Instead of coverting an IP addr to string and to string matching, it is more sane to try to covert the host/name to IP addr (anyhow in 99% it will be an IP as it is taken from VIA hdr). The old string matching fails for IPv6 as the string representation of an IPv6 is not unique (like for IPv4) - you may have compact format for IPv6.

2018-03-28  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [48129c321] :

	usrloc/registrar: Implement cachedb federation clustering
	The "federation-cachedb" clustering revolves around the following three
	metadata-related operations:
	    - on AoR save: ensure the following NoSQL key/multi-value is present:
	      { pk: <key>, aor: <aor>, home_ip: <home_ip> }. This advertises
	      the AoR's presence in our location to other PoPs.
	    - on AoR lookup: fetch all <home_ip> values of <aor>, add as
	      call branches of the current INVITE, on top of any existing local
	      contact branches
	    - on AoR remove: delete our <key> from NoSQL, as well as the AoR
	      from local storage.

	This is useful when an OpenSIPS ping originator node is front-ended

	the front-end will still respond to the pings (e.g. 408 Request Timeout),

	* [f7bed45a4] :

	Added support for sharding/partitioning cluster.
	A sharding clustering is a presence cluster where each node keeps its own set of watchers and presentities of an interest. Any new Published presentity is replicated to all the cluster nodes, but stored only by nodes interested in it (if there are watchers for that presentity). For initial subscriptions, there is quering mechnism inside the cluster - to try to fetch the presentity data from any other node.

	* [4feff3ea6] :

	Added support for extra headers per body part.
	When adding a body part (directly via sipmsgops module or indirectly via sip_i module), you can specify an optional list of SIP headers (fully formated, including the header terminator) to be pushed into the part next to the Content-Type header.
	The specific changes:
	* in sipmsgops module, the add_body_part() takes a third optional parameter for extra headers to be pushed into the part;
	* in sip_i module, the add_isup_part() funtion takes a second optional parameter for defining a custom set of extra headers;
	* in sip_i_module, a new module parameter "default_part_headers" can be used to define the default set of headers to be automatically pushed into the ISUP parts.

	* [e0fe570fe] :

	usrloc/nathelper: Compute and report ping latencies
	This patch adds a new nathelper branch flag, "sipping_latency_flag", to
	enable ping latency computation. Also, a new usrloc event is now available,
	E_UL_LATENCY_UPDATE. All contact-related usrloc events now include a new
	parameter, "latency", which holds the latency of the last successful
	ping if any, or 0 otherwise. If available, the ping latency can also be
	accessed via MI, using the "Ping-Latency" key of the contact data.

	build system: Add special handling for gcc 7.2

	$ gcc -dumpversion
	7
	$ gcc -dumpfullversion
	7.2.0

	This breaks compilation on systems such as Xubuntu 17.10 with:

	Makefile.defs:930: You are using an old and unsupported gcc version
	(7), compile at your own risk!

	This backwards-incompatible change seems to have been reverted in 7.3+,

	* [2d3c0733d] :

	Add a basic unit testing framework
	Currently, this framework only supports writing unit tests for core
	code, but there are plans to expand it such that module tests can be
	easily written as well.

	The chosen C unit testing framework is libtap
	(https://github.com/zorgnax/libtap) - very lightweight and full of goodies.

	In order to write a core unit test, you should write the test file
	under a "test/" dir which resides right next to the tested file. The
	build system is smart enough to link any such test files placed in
	random test dirs all across the core codebase. Next, you enrol your
	test file to be init'ed and run in test/unit_tests.c, and you're done.

	To run the entire unit testing suite, just do "make test". You will
	have to type this command twice if you haven't enabled "-DUNIT_TESTS"
	under Makefile.conf beforehand.

2018-01-29  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [091149b07] :

	Added new load support based on active/idle time.
	The way the internal load is calculated and reported is radically changed. Instead of providing per-interface load and only for SIP related processing, the new "load" support calculates per process the amount of time spent in any processing (outside the I/O reactor) versus total time. The time granularity is 1us. This new system covers any kind of handling (SIP, timer, async, etc) inside a process.
	The TCP main and timer handler will also provide load information. In the future, the extra processes (per module) may easily record their load information.
	Each process (and globally) reports 3 load statistics:
	* realtime load, computed over the last 1s
	* last 1 minute load
	* last 10 minutes load

	Example via "opensipsctl fifo get_statistics load:" :
	load:load:: 24
	load:load1m:: 19
	load:load10m:: 1
	load:load-proc-1:: 0
	load:load1m-proc-1:: 0
	load:load10m-proc-1:: 0
	load:load-proc-2:: 0

	use of this feature.

	Although the TMCB_RESPONSE_IN callback provides a reference to the initial

	PKG-based, while the request buffer is copied in SHM.

	The current workaround for mid_registrar is to immediately duplicate all
	contact-related data we could possibly need, should the contact successfully
	register on the downstream registrar. This copying takes place during request
	processing. Once the reply arrives, we only make use of this info in order to
	store the contact in usrloc, and barely even use the "req" sip_msg
	provided by tm.

	mid_registrar: Fix NAT issues in "contact" insertion mode
	This patch completely reworks the saving/matching logic with regards
	to the SIP contacts generated by the mid-registrar. It is only relevant
	to working modes "0" (mirror) and "1" (contact throttling).

	The former logic (encoding the requests's Contact as a URI parameter
	of the outgoing contact) was somewhat stateless, as it would forward
	requests to the mid-registrar's contacts directly to their actual Contact
	URIs (UA side). When NAT comes into play, this no longer works well.

	Fortunately, the user location already handles this problem. Thus, we
	change the mid-registrar to advertise contact IDs instead of the device's
	contact. As requests arrive for the contact IDs, we are easily able to
	look up their corresponding user location AoR, contact, along with any
	other useful information for NAT traversal.

	* [ad274fad9] :

	usrloc: Add urecord reference counting mechanism
	This mechanism is required by the mid-registrar, which needs to
	"reserve" contact IDs while the main registrar decides upon them.
	This means that a blank urecord structure must be kept alive during
	this process.

	By reference counting the blank urecord structures, we prevent them
	from being cleared by the timer before the outgoing registrations
	get a chance to receive a reply.

	Relying on the fact that all modules that register dialog callbacks are initialised

	(i.e reloading from database via MI cmd or receiving replicated dialog).

	"dlg_db_sync" MI command or received replicated dialogs which do not have their
	callbacks installed or run.

	The TMCB_RESPONSE_IN function gets called once per each retransmission,

2017-07-25  Maksym Sobolyev  <sobomax at sippysoft dot com>
	* [60c80b298] :

	Rename LIST_HEAD() macro into OSIPS_LIST_HEAD() to avoid collision with the BSD's sys/queue.h that declares macro with the same name. That include is pulled in by some other  system includes and that breaks the build.

	And the read op will try to dump the traced data aquired by the write (connect) op -> different processes, different memory chuncks
	To avoid such probles, the "connect" tracing will be flushed on write (a connect is always trigger by a write need) and the "accept" tracing will be flushed only on read (an accept is always followed by a read).

	Connections which received a read event concurrently with their

	The fix involves adding a TCP connection lifetime update in the TCP worker

		This commit fixes 2 bugs:

	because of bad parsed pointer update;
		2) fixes major bug that was causing packets to be processed
	infinite times by hep callback when one message + some part of a
	second message came in a chunk and in the second chunk it was the
	second part of the second message; the tcp request structure was
	not updated(complete was not set to 0 after first message was
	processed) causing the second message to be processed an infinte amount
	of times into the database;
