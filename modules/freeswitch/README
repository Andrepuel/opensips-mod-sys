Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   The "freeswitch" module is a C driver for the FreeSWITCH Event
   Socket Layer interface. It can interact with one or more
   FreeSWITCH servers either by issuing commands to them, or by
   receiving events from them.

   This driver can be seen as a centralized FreeSWITCH ESL
   connection manager. OpenSIPS modules may use its API in order
   to easily establish, reference and reuse ESL connections.

   A FreeSWITCH ESL URL is of the form:
   fs://[username]:password@host[:port]. The default ESL port is
   8021.

1.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running OpenSIPS with this module loaded:
     * None

2.1. By Commit Statistics

   Table 2.1. Top contributors by DevScore^(1), authored
   commits^(2) and lines added/removed^(3)
     Name DevScore Commits Lines ++ Lines --
   1. Liviu Chircu (@liviuchircu) 35 20 1191 255
   2. Razvan Crainea (@razvancrainea) 5 3 18 10
   3. Bogdan-Andrei Iancu (@bogdan-iancu) 3 1 1 1

   (1) DevScore = author_commits + author_lines_added /
   (project_lines_added / project_commits) + author_lines_deleted
   / (project_lines_deleted / project_commits)

   (2) including any documentation-related commits, excluding
   merge commits. Regarding imported patches/code, we do our best
   to count the work on behalf of the proper owner, as per the
   "fix_authors" and "mod_renames" arrays in
   opensips/doc/build-contrib.sh. If you identify any
   patches/commits which do not get properly attributed to you,
   please submit a pull request which extends "fix_authors" and/or
   "mod_renames".

   (3) ignoring whitespace edits, renamed files and auto-generated
   files

2.2. By Commit Activity
